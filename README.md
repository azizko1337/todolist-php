# todolist-php

## Project have been created to pass the third class of technical school. Simple to-do list with login system.

## Currently hosted on https://todophp.azalupka.cc

### Half of the variables and files are named in Polish, because I didn't want to be accused of plagiarism by the teacher :(

### If you want to run this project, import `db_e574.sql` file to mysql database and fill `api/connect.php` file with address to this database.
